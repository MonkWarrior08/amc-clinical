[SECTION: Instructions_for_patient]
You are a 44-year-old plumber in a rural town. Four weeks ago you had severe chest pain and you were admitted as an emergency to the local hospital. You were told that you had had a heart attack. After lots of tests you had urgent bypass surgery in a big city hospital.
You are now back home. On discharge from the hospital you were given a long list of medications to take. You have never needed tablets before and keep forgetting to take them.
You are unsure what the tablets are for as you assumed the bypass surgery cured the problems. You have all the tablets with you in a shopping bag in case the GP asks you what you are taking. You have the following questions for the GP:
—Why do I need to take tablets when the operation fixed the problem?
—What does each tablet do?
—How long will I be on these tablets?
—Do they have any side effects?
You take:
—Atorvastatin 80 mg once per day
—Glyceryl trinitrate spray as required for chest pain
—Aspirin 100 mg once per day
—Clopidogrel 75 mg once per day
—Perindopril 5 mg once per day
—Metoprolol 50 mg once per day.
You are an ex-smoker and do not drink alcohol. You do no regular exercise. The following information is on your medical record at the local GP surgery you are attending today.
Once the GP has discussed your worries about the medication you will be interested to hear any other advice the GP offers. If the GP starts to give other advice before answering your concerns about the medication you will get quite cranky and irritable.

[SECTION: Suggested_approach]
Suggested approach to the case
Establish rapport
Explore Dilip’s understanding and concerns about his medication
Ask if there are any other queries today:
Why do I need to take tablets when the operation fixed the problem?
The operation has bypassed the blocked blood vessels or ‘pipes’. You need to keep the new vessels or ‘pipes’ open and prevent blockages in any other of your blood vessels. This is best done with a healthy lifestyle and medication.
What does each tablet do?
* Atorvastatin 80 mg tablets help to stop fat build-up in the blood vessels along with a healthy diet that includes five pieces of vegetables and two fruit per day.
* Glyceryl trinitrate spray prn helps to open up the blood vessels to get more oxygen to the heart if you have any chest pain.
* Aspirin 100 mg od and Clopidogrel 75 mg od both ‘thin’ the blood. They reduce the risk of blood clots and another heart attack.
* Perindopril 5 mg od is an ACE inhibitor. It works on a chemical in the kidney that makes your blood pressure go up. An ACE inhibitor protects the kidneys and keeps your blood pressure down, which reduces the risk of another heart attack.
* Metoprolol is a beta-blocker. This blocks any excess adrenaline from damaging your heart and blood vessels by slowing your heart rate and lowering your blood pressure.
How long will I be on these tablets?
You will be able to stop the Clopidogrel a year after your surgery. Normally it is best for people to stay on the other medication. This will be reviewed at regular intervals.
Do they have any side effects?
All medications have potential side effects. If you are concerned if something might be a side effect either phone or come in for advice. The common ones are:
* Atorvastatin—muscle pains
* Glyceryl trinitrate spray prn—headaches, dizziness
* Aspirin—stomach pains (gastritis)
* Clopidogrel—bleeding, diarrhoea
* Perindopril—cough
* Metoprolol—tiredness, cold hands and feet, impotence.
If you have time, raise other common concerns—understanding of procedure done, return to driving (minimum 4 weeks post-CABG for private car), return to work, advice about sexual activity, mood disturbance post-heart attack.
Summarise information
Surgery was needed to bypass the blocked blood vessels
Aim now to get fit and stay healthy by:
* Taking medication as prescribed
* Regular checkups—blood pressure, lipids
* Not smoking
* Graded increase in exercise
* Healthy diet—offer dietician referral
Offer to provide printed patient handout on any of these topics.
[COMMENTARY]
Helping patients understand their medications and our rationale for prescribing them is an important aspect of general practice chronic disease management.
Dilip is a plumber who spends his life fixing blocked pipes. He understands the principles of coronary artery bypass grafting well but needs to also understand the risk of reblockage and what can be done to prevent it.
The GP should be able to explain the role of each medication and its potential side effects in straightforward lay terms, as this will increase Dilip’s chances of following the advice being given. The GP will also need to discuss other cardiovascular risk factors such as exercise and smoking. Patients recovering from surgery have many concerns. Dilip firstly wants his questions answered about the drugs but will also be grateful to a GP who raises more sensitive issues, such as mood disorders and when it is safe to resume sexual intercourse.
[PITFALL]
Dilip wants to be treated with respect. He needs more than just being told to take the tablets because ‘the hospital said so’.
The GP may be tempted to criticise the hospital for not giving Dilip enough information about his medication. Experience suggests that patients remember less than half of what they are told. Factors that make this worse are fear, pain, recent anaesthesia and anxiety, all of which may apply to Dilip. It’s important to give him information politely and not to assume that the hospital made no effort. But if this is a consistent gap with a particular hospital unit it is worth phoning the consultant to let them know your observation and ask what systems are in place. If Dilip continues to be perplexed or uncertain about his medication, the GP can ask if he would like a Home Medicines Review with a pharmacist.

[SECTION: Instructions_for_patient]
You are a 50-year-old taxi driver. You feel heaviness in your chest on exercise. The heaviness lasts for less than a minute if you stop what you are doing. You are worried that this heaviness comes from your heart. It has been getting worse and you have finally admitted that you need help. At the back of your mind is the fact that your mother died of a heart attack. You have not had any palpitations but when pressed admit that you have some shortness of breath at the same time as you get the chest pain.
The most likely diagnosis is angina.

Check emotional impact of possible diagnosis
Recommend urgent attendance at hospital/call ambulance if pain not settling at 10 minutes!
Check and discuss implication for driving
Ensure follow-up and offer health promotion (immunisations, check alcohol intake, advice re exercise).
[COMMENTARY]
This is a case of angina. In the time available the doctor should be able to state angina as the most likely diagnosis. When this probable diagnosis is mentioned for the first time, a good doctor will watch carefully for Jackie’s reaction and allow her to vent her feelings.
Knowing when to test troponin is difficult. It is indicated in suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) but not in chronic stable angina. Urgent hospital admission and assessment is the appropriate management of ACS, not troponin testing in the surgery. Jackie’s symptoms don’t meet the criteria for ACS and her angina is not yet stable, so it is reasonable to do a troponin test provided follow-up is in place, both to ensure the result arrives and is actioned urgently if indicated.
Aspirin is recommended in angina but caution is needed because of the past history of gastro-oesophageal reflux, and Jackie will need to be asked about recurrences of pain in follow-up.
Beta-blockers, nitrates and calcium channel blockers appear to be equally effective for symptom relief. If Jackie remains symptomatic treatments can be combined, except for beta-blockers + diltiazem or verpamil.
A safety point is to consider the impact of angina on Jackie’s work as a taxi driver. Doctors are not expected to remember the rules regarding angina and commercial vehicle drivers, but must be aware that this is an issue and tell the facilitator that they would check the regulations and advise Jackie accordingly. Jackie meets the standards for private driving but not the commercial standard. Jackie would need to be off work until a cardiologist assesses the severity of the angina.

You are a retired farmer aged 76. You are used to hard physical work and are worried because you can no longer walk very far. You did not want to bother the doctor about it but finally let your daughter make an appointment when she saw you struggling at the weekend.
You get a cramp-like pain in your right leg after walking a certain distance. Once you stop and rest for five minutes you can continue on further. Currently you can get to the first paddock, about 500 m, but then have to lean on the gate for a while until the pain in your leg goes away.
You do not have any nocturnal pain or any other symptoms of cardiovascular disease.
You roll your own cigarettes and get through about 20 a day. You drink two or three cans of beer at the weekend. You have considered giving up smoking and would like advice from the doctor on how to do this, particularly if the doctor thinks that this will improve your leg pain.

Referral to vascular surgery if femoral pulses absent, critical ischaemia (urgent) or persistent symptoms despite medical treatment.
[COMMENTARY]
Mr Schmidt gives a clear history and typical examination findings of a person with intermittent claudication. Doctors need to demonstrate that the leg is not critically ischaemic and measure the ankle–brachial pressure index (ABPI) to confirm peripheral arterial disease—an ABPI less than 0.9 is diagnostic. The risk to the limb is low but the risk to life is high through other cardiovascular problems such as myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular disease. The focus of management should be on the reduction of cardiovascular risk by treating any dyslipidaemia, diabetes and hypertension and stopping smoking, regular walking and dietary modification.
The doctor will need to explain the link between the current pain and cardiovascular risk factors and use motivational interviewing techniques to discuss smoking cessation.
Mr Schmidt has an occupational risk of tetanus but there is no information in the summary sheet about his immunisations. Good doctors will notice this and arrange a review of Mr Schmidt’s immunisations at another appointment.

Advise of follow-up arrangements.
[COMMENTARY]
The most likely cause of Mrs Smythe’s shortness of breath is congestive cardiac failure. The prevalence of chronic heart failure is over 50% in people over 85 years of age. The doctor needs to take a history and conduct an examination that confirms this and excludes other possible common causes, such as anaemia or a respiratory problem. Once the diagnosis is confirmed the doctor can assess the severity of the shortness of breath and plan appropriate management.
The term ‘heart failure’ is alarming to many patients. The doctor will need to explain clearly what this means and that treatment aims to reduce symptoms and prevent disease progression.
This case gives the doctor the opportunity to promote multidisciplinary care. For example, an exercise physiologist or physiotherapist might offer an exercise program or a social worker might ensure that Mrs Smythe fully accesses any entitlements to financial support. Referral to volunteer services or a day care centre may prevent Mrs Smythe’s current illness becoming a reason for being isolated and housebound. Could a practice nurse be delegated to offer immunisations and take blood for follow-up tests? Mrs Smythe might not know of all these services so it is appropriate for the GP to let her know what is available and offer to facilitate these through the Medicare Team Care Arrangements.

[SECTION: Instructions_for_patient]
Over the past few years you have become dependent on morphine capsules. It all started when you had a kidney stone and realised that the drug not only eased your physical pain but also blotted out other pains in your life. Your parents are now separated but when they were together they spent much time arguing and fighting and sometimes you got beaten up too.
You have been on various youth schemes but have never had a regular job. You moved to the city so that you could see lots of different doctors to get the morphine that you crave.
You have never tried other drugs but have sometimes wondered whether injecting would give you more of a ‘hit’ than the capsules. You haven’t considered giving up morphine because you can’t see any better way of easing the pain in your life.
Today you are seeing this new doctor with the intention of saying that you had acute renal colic last night and that you need morphine to relieve the pain.
You say that the pain was right-sided and was severe enough to have you rolling around in agony. You had two pills left over from your previous prescription, which helped you get through the night but you now need some more. When asked, you have some haematuria but no other urinary symptoms.
You have no other relevant past medical history.

Consider opportunistic health promotion about smoking, need for Hepatitis B and other immunisations.
[COMMENTARY]
Craig is addicted to morphine and is seeking a script from the doctor. GPs need to be cautious when prescribing opiates and have a high index of suspicion that patients are drug seeking. Warning signs of patients seeking drugs are:
* Reception and appointment: new patient recently moved, walk-ins, last-minute appointments
* History: very knowledgeable about condition and drugs requested, previous doctor ‘unavailable’, multiple allergies or reactions to non-addictive medications, carries letter from other doctors about opiate or benzodiazepine prescriptions with dubious rationale
* Examination: exaggerated appearance of pain, inconsistent behaviour and signs.
Patients who are prescribed opiates either for pain or as part of a rehabilitation scheme (usually methadone) will carry documentation with them regarding their condition and should not be offended by probing questions from a GP. A wise GP will still check that the supporting letter is valid.
[PITFALL]
This case tests the doctor’s skill at refusing a patient’s request. A firm but polite no is needed. Other options for managing this case would be offering alternative analgesia or prescribing enough morphine capsules to last only the next 24 hours while you gather further information from his previous GP.
Inexperienced or poor doctors may fail to see through Craig’s story and will issue a script for the morphine as requested; alternatively, they may say no so aggressively that there is no opportunity to work with Craig on his addiction or other problems, such as the past history of abuse.

[COMMENTARY]
Assessing fitness to drive can be a challenging aspect of general practice as the GP’s public health role may need to take precedence over the role of caring for an individual patient. Doctors are not expected to remember the ‘Fitness to Drive’ standards but should be familiar with the document and find the information that shows Wazza does not meet the commercial licence standards. For Wazza this will mean loss of his livelihood until he can either be treated, for example with continuous positive airways pressure, or see if significant weight loss will reverse the symptoms.
Obesity is a risk factor for multiple chronic diseases and Wazza should be offered a preventive health check, though maintaining a therapeutic relationship when you have just removed someone’s driving licence tests communication skills.

[INSTRUCTION]
Kylie does not attend this appointment but please take a history from her mother, Ilana, and make suggestions for management. You are required to focus on the presenting complaint only.
[SCENARIO]
Kylie Chong is an 8-year-old girl who has seen you a few times for minor illnesses in childhood. Kylie’s mum, Ilana, has booked to see you today because ‘Kylie is out of control and won’t do what she is told’. Ilana wants you to prescribe the drug that is used in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

[SECTION: Instructions_for_patient]
You have three children and work part-time as a cleaner. You were brought up in Australia and so was your husband. His family emigrated to Australia from China. Your husband and his family consider child rearing to be the mother’s main responsibility.
Kylie is the middle child of the family. From the beginning she has been a challenge but recently you just cannot control her. She is doing OK at school but her behaviour is very disruptive at home. It is so frustrating that the teachers report her to be good while at home Kylie is disobedient and will not join in with the family. Getting her up to go to school in the mornings is a nightmare and at weekends all she does is watch TV and eat junk food. You have tried an elimination diet but that made no difference.
* You have come to the doctor today because you have heard there is a drug for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and you think it might be the answer for Kylie.
If the doctor asks about the three main symptoms of ADHD of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness, you are to answer that Kylie does NOT have these symptoms.

[COMMENTARY]
Kylie is causing problems but the doctor needs to work out whether she has ADHD. This is characterised by inattention, hyperactivity and/or impulsiveness. This does not fit with Kylie’s story of being able to concentrate on the TV for much of the day and her reasonable performance and behaviour at school.
The doctor will need to demonstrate empathy with Ilana about Kylie’s problem and sensitively explain that the treatment for ADHD will not help, as it seems to be more of a behavioural issue. The doctor can then outline the options available to assist Ilana and her family. This could entail support and guidance from the GP or referral to more specialised children’s services, depending on local availability and Ilana’s choice.

You work as a pharmacy assistant three days a week and spend the other days at home with your children. Your daughter, aged four, attends preschool and Brandon, your two-year-old, attends child care.
Four weeks ago Brandon had ‘gastro’. He was vomiting and had diarrhoea. The vomiting soon settled and as advised you continued with fluids and reintroduced solids when Brandon seemed hungry.
Brandon is thriving and seems well but the diarrhoea has not stopped. He passes a light-coloured, loose, watery, foul-smelling stool about five times a day and you can see undigested food in it. Previously Brandon passed 1–3 stools per day. The situation is beginning to get you down because the staff at child care are worried about him and keep suggesting that he is not well enough to be there. When you talked with the pharmacist at work she suggested you go back to the GP for a checkup.

[COMMENTARY]
The most important clinical feature is that Brandon is thriving. The fact that he is still on the 75th centile excludes any potentially serious cause of the diarrhoea and the doctor should emphasise this with Julie.
Brandon’s symptoms are characteristic of toddler or chronic non-specific diarrhoea, the commonest cause of diarrhoea in children aged 1–5 years. Some speculate this is an iatrogenic problem that starts when parents are advised to push fluids, including fruit juices, and reduce fibre and fat intake, in children with gastroenteritis. Children then enter a vicious cycle of diarrhoea and further dietary restrictions aimed at curing the diarrhoea. Treatment is rebalancing the ‘four Fs’—Fat, Fibre, Fluid and Fruit juices—by reintroducing well-defined meals and snacks. Fruit juices, in particular clear apple juice, and other squashes should be limited. Toddler diarrhoea might be prevented by advising that children with acute diarrhoea require initial rehydration and then resumption of a normal feeding pattern as soon as it is tolerated.
Other common possible causes of Brandon’s diarrhoea are residual infection (such as with Giardia), carbohydrate intolerance or temporary lactose intolerance. Carbohydrate intolerance results in unabsorbed disaccharides in the stool which show positive on Clinitest or glucose testing strips. Fermentation of unabsorbed sugars produces acids which yield a stool pH of <5.5. In temporary lactose intolerance, reduction of milk-based products is recommended for a short time. If the symptoms do not resolve in a week then this is not the cause of the problem and milk can be reintroduced. More complex changes to his diet would need supervision from a dietician to ensure any benefit in reducing the diarrhoea is not achieved at the expense of malnutrition.
The concern of the day care centre about Brandon’s diarrhoea should be discussed. Once a stool test is confirmed as clear, Brandon can attend again and will not pose a risk to the health of the other children or the carers. The GP can offer to put this in writing to the day care centre or even offer to run an in-service training session for staff on chronic diarrhoea.

Edward reports that he sometimes cannot see when he is playing golf. It is easy to assume that this is a problem with his visual acuity when in fact it is just that the excess watery tears reduce his vision. Careful questioning and assessment of visual acuity is needed to clarify the problem.

[CASE_ID: Natalie_Jones]
[SECTION_ID: Child_health]
[SECTION: Instruction_for_doc]
[CASE_TYPE:short]
[INSTRUCTION]
Please conduct this consultation as you would in your clinical practice.
[SCENARIO]
Mrs Jacinta Jones comes in to see you to discuss Natalie, her six-year-old daughter. She had taken Natalie to a paediatrician because her asthma was not well controlled on her medication of prophylactic cromoglycate and salbutamol.
You have read the letter from the paediatrician suggesting that Natalie start on inhaled steroids. You are not quite sure why Mrs Jones has booked this appointment to see you today, particularly as she did not come to see you about Natalie before going to the paediatrician.

[SECTION: Instructions_for_patient]
You are an articulate business executive in your late thirties. You live in a large house in a prestigious area of Sydney and travel a substantial amount for work. Natalie is your only child and you had her ‘later on’ so that you could establish your career first. Your husband is also in business and leaves the child care arrangements to you.
Natalie is six years old and has asthma. You are often up at night when she coughs and this is exhausting for both of you. Natalie uses a salbutamol inhaler and cromoglycate as a preventer. You recently took Natalie to see a private paediatrician about the asthma. You did not ask your GP for a referral.
You are concerned that the paediatrician has decided to start Natalie on steroids. You know they are banned in athletes and do not understand why they are being given to Natalie. You have made an appointment to see the GP and have the following questions on your mind:
1. Why has Natalie been recommended steroids? How do they work?
2. Is there any alternative medication that could be tried?
3. How will the GP know if the medication is helping Natalie?
4. How will the GP watch to make sure Natalie isn’t getting any side effects from the medication?
5. The paediatrician gave you a funny box (a spacer) for helping Natalie use the medication. You are not sure how to use it and would like the doctor to show you how to use it.

[SECTION: Suggested_approach]
Suggested approach to the case
Establish rapport
Open-ended questions to establish Mrs Jones’ ideas, concerns and expectations about this consultation and Natalie’s asthma
Answer Mrs Jones in terms that are understood, in a non-judgmental manner.
1. Explain that asthma is due to inflammation. Steroids are anti-inflammatory and will reduce the amount of wheezing and coughing and make it easier for Natalie to breathe.
Explore why Mrs Jones is concerned about steroids: what has she heard about them and from whom? Tailor further answers about steroids to Mrs Jones’ specific concerns.
Mrs Jones has heard that steroids are banned in athletes. The doctor can reassure her that there are different types of steroids and that the body-building steroids abused by some athletes are different from the anti-inflammatory steroids used in asthma.
2. Explore with Mrs Jones what medication has already been tried.
Outline the rationale for obtaining good asthma control and for helping Natalie to feel better. Natalie has previously tried regular cromoglycate as a preventer and uses salbutamol for symptom relief. She has not tried other medication. The next step according to current guidelines is to introduce inhaled corticosteroids; leukotriene antagonists are an option in children with mild persistent asthma.
3. Explain the role of monitoring Natalie’s asthma symptoms. Asthma control is monitored by:
—Assessment of symptoms—cough, wheeze, nocturnal cough, shortness of breath, exercise tolerance
—Absence of signs—wheeze, peak expiratory flow rate, spirometry
—Function—can Natalie do all the sport and activities that she would like to or does her asthma stop her?
4. Side effects such as oral thrush and dysphonia are possible with inhaled corticosteroids. These can be reduced by using a spacer and rinsing the mouth after inhalation. Longer-term side effects include the development of cataracts, reduced bone density, depression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and delay in growth.
The list of potential problems from inhaled corticosteroids is long. The doctor needs to give a balanced description of the potential risks and benefits of this medication.
The doctor can inform Mrs Jones that the lowest effective dose of inhaled steroids will be used and that Natalie’s growth and general development will be monitored. The evidence is that older inhaled corticosteroids, such as beclomethasone, mainly delay growth rather than inhibit it. Long-term studies show that inhaled corticosteroids in conventional doses do not have significant long-term effects on growth and the benefits outweigh the side effects. The effect of fluticasone on growth may be less but the outcome of long-term studies is awaited.
5. Demonstrate use of spacer device.
[COMMENTARY]
This case tests the doctor’s communication skills and understanding of the management of childhood asthma. Another twist is the potential for interprofessional issues to interfere with Natalie’s care.
In the health system in Australia patients are referred to specialists by their GPs. However, many people are willing to pay for direct access to specialists. Natalie’s asthma is not severe and would normally be dealt with by a GP. The GP may feel undermined that Mrs Jones has taken Natalie to a specialist.
Wounded professional pride is compounded by having to deal with Mrs Jones’ response to the suggestions of inhaled corticosteroids. The GP should put aside their own reactions and approach Mrs Jones professionally and in Natalie’s best interests.
The doctor needs to explore why Mrs Jones is concerned about giving Natalie steroids. While the doctor could guess at the causes for her concern from their general knowledge of patients’ reactions, the reassurance will be more effective if it addresses Mrs Jones’ particular fears.
Some doctors may feel threatened by Mrs Jones’ questioning of medical advice. A good doctor will be able to discuss the issue with Mrs Jones as if in a partnership whereas a poor doctor may show irritation and resort to medical dominance or cave in and, in an effort to appease Mrs Jones, deny Natalie the medication she needs.
Spacers come with simple written instructions, as I discovered as a young mum with a wheezy child. If you are not confident in using a spacer or in instructing others how to use a spacer, ask your local pharmacist if you can look at one and read the instructions for use.

[TREATMENT]
Intermittent topical steroid

Consider referral if no improvement.
[COMMENTARY]
The key issue in this case is to demonstrate competence in the management of a common skin condition. There are no hidden twists in this case. A good doctor will establish a good relationship with Jeanette and explore the social and psychological impact of the problem as well as discuss medical management. For example the doctor could allow Jeanette to express her concerns about returning to work and having to ask staff at the child care centre to put on creams. Or ask what impact is the problem having on her relationship with Sammy or her partner?
About 75% of children grow out of their eczema by the age of five, but the strong family history of atopy makes this less likely in Sammy’s case. Regular use of emollients and intermittent topical steroids are the mainstay of therapy; topical calcineurin inhibitors and cognitive behavioural therapy to break the itch/scratch cycle are welcome developments in eczema management for older children.
The role of food allergy is controversial: allergen testing is recommended in severe eczema. Elimination diets need to be supervised by a dietician.
[PITFALL]
Pitfalls to avoid are the prescription of steroid creams without explanation regarding judicious use—avoiding both under-treatment and over-treatment—and the potential side effects, and failing to consider that the tea-tree oil is exacerbating the problem.

[COMMENTARY]
Psoriasis affects over 6% of Australian Caucasian adults and can be diagnosed on the clinical characteristics of well-defined, erythematous, thickened plaques covered with adherent silvery scales. Psoriasis is an auto-immune related condition in genetically susceptible individuals: activated T lymphocytes release cytokines that cause keratinocyte proliferation. While the diagnosis is easy, treatment is can be messy and is aimed at containing the problem rather than cure. Topical steroids and calcipotriene together may work better than either agent alone. Patients with psoriasis involving more than 20 per cent of their skin or those not responding to topical therapy are candidates for systemic therapy.
There is a high financial and emotional cost to psoriasis. A biopsychosocial framework will assist doctors to cover the important aspects of management. Robert needs advice on what medications to use and how to use them but may also wish to discuss the impact that the psoriasis has on his self-image, his relationships and his work.

[COMMENTARY]
Ruby’s pain is caused by a sore tooth. This will become obvious as the doctor takes the history and taps the teeth. After hours and in rural areas GPs are often required to provide care for dental problems. Antibiotics are only indicated if there is possible cellulitis secondary to an infected tooth. Dental abscesses require incision and drainage and root canal treatment or extraction.
There is a long list of possible features to check in the face. A good doctor can focus promptly on examination of the teeth, lymph nodes and temporomandibular joints. If tapping the teeth with a tongue depressor reproduces the pain there is no need to proceed with further examination. The time can then be spent explaining the diagnosis, planning management and exploring any particular concerns that Ruby has. A doctor who does a complete examination will not have time to explore the concerns about Ruby’s father’s tongue cancer or have time to discuss Ruby’s vaccination status.

[COMMENTARY]
Benign thyroid enlargement is the most likely cause of a midline neck swelling in a pregnant woman like Jane. A doctor should take a history about the swelling and any local symptoms and establish whether she is clinically hypothyroid or hyperthyroid. The neck examination should reveal that the swelling moves on swallowing. Examination of the lymph nodes should show that the doctor knows the position of the lymph nodes and should be conducted from behind.
Traditional teaching is that any neck swelling or lump requires examination of the scalp, ears, skin, face, mouth and throat. This is vital if the lump is an enlarged lymph node but is not needed in this case where the history and examination findings are so suggestive of a thyroid problem. This is an example of pattern recognition rather than hypothetico-deductive thinking. Experienced GPs use pattern recognition as a method of clinical reasoning because it is much quicker, in this case, allowing the doctor time to check on thyroid status as well as the swelling. Doctors who use the hypothetico-deductive method reasoning through this case will be safe but will have used valuable time on unnecessary issues.
The doctor is not expected to discuss management of the swelling.

[COMMENTARY]
Dizziness is a common presentation with multiple potential causes. The history is essential to accurate diagnosis. The first step is to establish that Mrs Taylor uses the term dizziness to describe a spinning sensation (vertigo) and does not feel faint (suggests a cardiovascular cause).
The most likely cause in this case is a vestibular neuronitis based on the history and abnormal head impulse test that confirms a vestibulopathy. Benign positional vertigo can be excluded because the vertigo is not exclusively related to changes in posture. Menière’s disease is unlikely because there is no tinnitus. If the symptoms do not resolve, further investigation is needed to check for a cerebellar or cerebral lesion as well as the known vestibulopathy.
If possible, patients are recommended to manage without medication to enable quicker vestibular rehabilitation.
This case provides doctors with an opportunity to practise a neurological examination. This is a skill that is often learned for final year medical exams or the Australian Medical Council examination and then forgotten! It is possible to do this case in the time available but only if the neurological examination is selective and slick.

[COMMENTARY]
Tinnitus is common and affects up to one in ten people at any one time. For some people it is a significantly disabling problem. It is thought to originate from the central rather than peripheral auditory system.
The doctor needs to take a history, to ask for the results of a focused examination and to establish that the most likely cause is noise exposure earlier in the patient’s life. A vestibular Schwannoma would need to be excluded if the tinnitus and deafness shown on audiometry was unilateral.
Trevor needs reassurance that there is no underlying pathology to cause concern but the doctor should not dismiss the symptoms as insignificant or tell him glibly ‘Don’t worry about it’. Tinnitus is a risk factor for suicide. It is important that the doctor accurately assess Trevor’s psychological wellbeing and treat any associated anxiety or depression. Management focuses on ways to habituate to the noises and using hearing protection to prevent exacerbation.

[INSTRUCTION]
Please manage this medical emergency.
[SCENARIO]
Catriona Chryssides is a 29-year-old arts coordinator. You have been asked to see her as an emergency because of dizziness and palpitations on a Saturday morning.
You are doing a locum in a remote Aboriginal community. The clinic has a treatment room with emergency equipment. The nearest hospital is 300 km away and patients requiring urgent hospital care are evacuated by the RFDS plane. The specialists at the hospital provide telephone advice if needed. An Aboriginal Health Worker is also working in the clinic.
The facilitator will give you the physical examination findings and the results of initial investigations on specific request.

[SECTION: Instructions_for_patient]
You have just moved to the area as arts coordinator. You wanted a change of scene and to travel before your 30th birthday next month. It has been a major upheaval leaving your friends and family in the city. You are finding the work challenging and chaotic and wonder if you will ever be able to make a worthwhile contribution.
It’s Saturday morning. You started the day with a strong coffee and got up to go for a walk and felt fine. Suddenly you experienced a jolt in your heart and it feels as if it has gone haywire as it is pounding rapidly. You feel dizzy, unwell, a bit nauseated and frightened. You told your housemate how you felt and she promptly drove you down to the clinic.
You have never experienced anything like this before. You have no significant past medical history.
You smoke 10 cigarettes per day but do not consume alcohol.
Before leaving the city you made sure that you were up to date with your vaccinations and Pap smear. You have an Implanon contraceptive implant fitted.

[SECTION: info_for_facilator]
This scenario can be changed to assess the doctor’s emergency skills in their own clinical setting, for example, the venue could be a small rural hospital or a suburban general practice.
The observations are:
—Temperature normal
—Pulse 180 bts per minute, regular
—BP 92/64 mm Hg.
Please show the candidate the ECG recording once the monitor is attached. Refer to Figure 4, centre insert page C. (Note: an ECG is given rather than just rhythm strip to enable the candidate to proceed with definitive treatment in the time available for the case.)
Ask the candidate for their diagnosis when they have looked at the ECG.
Sinus rhythm is restored after the second (12 mg) bolus of adenosine.
When Catriona has returned to sinus rhythm ask the candidate to outline a future management plan.

[SECTION: Suggested_approach]

Breathing—breathing regularly, no visible restriction to lung movement, give oxygen via mask
Circulation—Pulse rapid
—Request Aboriginal health worker to check blood pressure
—BP 92/64 mm Hg
—Put on heart monitor and continue to monitor
—ECG interpretation
Patient assessed as having supraventricular tachycardia, haemodynamically stable.

Intravenous adenosine as bolus of 6 mg, 12 mg, plus 20 mL flush
(Note: if the candidate does not know the dose regime, it is acceptable for them to check this in a formulary)
Warning to patient of what to expect (sense of impending doom)
Returns to sinus rhythm with resolution of symptoms after second bolus.
Further management
Finish secondary survey
Review history
—History of palpitations
Explain what happened
Assess likely precipitants—caffeine intake, current stressors
Advice re means to stop if recurs
Advise re work—unlikely to need time off
Driving—check in Austroads book
ECG when in sinus rhythm to check for delta wave of Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome.
Future management
Arrange follow-up and, if recurrent, other treatments available such as medication or ablation
Health promotion—smoking cessation.
[COMMENTARY]
This scenario tests the doctor’s ability to cope with an emergency situation. A logical and calm approach is needed and the doctor should proceed through DRABC in sequence. Some doctors who trialled this care argued that assessing Danger should not be needed when working in a clinic. They made a good point but I’ve left it in because it reinforces the need to consider staff and patient safety when responding to an emergency, and because of the realities of weekend on-call work when reduced staffing may mean omission of checks of emergency equipment.
This case also tests a doctor’s ability to work well with the Aboriginal Health Worker and give clear instructions.
The doctor is expected to recognise the pattern of the SVT on the ECG and immediately commence vagal stimulation to try to revert the rhythm. The order of pharmacological treatment is adenosine and then verapamil. If these are ineffective, telephone advice should be sought about other options such as flecainide, sotalol or disopyramide, but availability of these drugs may be a problem. Not all clinics stock adenosine and so it is acceptable for a doctor to stabilise Catriona and arrange for the RFDS to give adenosine on arrival.
DC reversion is reserved for patients who are haemodynamically unstable and requires sedation. Longer-term recurrent SVT may be treated by ablation therapy.
Once the emergency is under control, the doctor needs to consider other important aspects of care such as her fitness for work, driving, what to do if she has another episode and when she should be reviewed. Doctors are not expected to remember the detail of the DVLA book but must know to look at it for advice.
[PITFALL]
Carrie’s public hypoglycaemic episode means that emergency care needs to be given in a public space. However, the doctor needs to distinguish carefully between emergency care and routine ongoing care. The latter should be given by Carrie’s GP of choice and in the privacy of the consulting room, and will include finding out reasons for the hypoglycaemic episode, assessing her fitness to drive and work.

You are 28 years old and have had insulin-dependent diabetes for 15 years. You have just moved to this area for work as a barmaid. You enjoy the work but the late hours make it difficult to control your blood sugar.
You wear a medical alert bracelet on your wrist that says you are an insulin-dependent diabetic.
This morning you set off on your bike to do some shopping. You began to feel hypoglycaemic but did not have any snacks with you. One minute you were riding along, the next thing you know is that you’re lying on the pavement next to your bicycle. This case begins with you lying beside your bicycle on the side of the road. A local GP comes up to you. You are able to say your name but mumble it slowly. If you are asked if you are diabetic, you can mumble ‘yes’.

As soon as the doctor realises that the person is diabetic on insulin, they should proceed with management of possible hypoglycaemia.
[TREATMENT]
You will recover quickly when the doctor gives you either:
* an injection of intravenous glucose
* an injection of glucagon IM, IV or SC, or
* oral/rectal glucose.
Glucagon IV, IM or SC—adult dosage: 1 mg, and/or
Glucose 50% IV at 3 mL/min via large vein—adult and paediatric dosage: 20–50 mL (depending on response)
The scenario should finish with clearance from the scene and arrangement for transport to a hospital/clinic, preferably by ambulance
Full physical examination will be required in the hospital or clinic.
[COMMENTARY]
GPs should be equipped to cope with simple medical emergencies such as hypoglycaemia. In urban areas, emergency care can often be provided more quickly by paramedics; in rural and remote Australia, the GP may be required to attend minor and major incidents at any time of night or day. Tight glycaemic control reduces the long-term complications of diabetes but increases the risk of hypoglycaemia.

[COMMENTARY]
Diabetes is a disease with multiple potential complications. A systematic approach is needed to ensure that all issues are discussed. A good doctor will be able to do this within a patient-centred framework. For example, the consultation would start with a general question about how Tim is and how life is going followed by exploring Tim’s current concerns about his diabetes. Tim’s concerns will be addressed first and then any issues noted by the doctor can be addressed. Tim is much more likely to listen to advice and implement change if he has identified the area of concern. Hearing about Tim’s lifestyle first will enable the doctor to ensure the advice is feasible and appropriate.
Diabetes care is increasingly performed by different disciplines. The degree to which care is shared among professionals will vary. What does not change is the GP’s responsibility to ensure that this care is being done and to provide it if necessary. All GPs need to be able to screen for diabetic retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy, although this screening is often delegated to an optometrist and podiatrist respectively.
The last aspects of the case are organisational. A Service Incentive Payment can be claimed from Medicare if a full cycle of diabetes care is complete. A good doctor will also ask Tim if he consents to be on the practice recall system for diabetes.

[COMMENTARY]
Tiredness is a common problem in general practice for which doctors need a system for assessment. This should be a stepped approach focusing on the common causes initially. Australian research shows that testing is high and few (3%) of patients have a significant clinical diagnosis based on an abnormal pathology test. More elaborate tests risk false positives.
Veronica has hypothyroidism. The doctor should explain that this is a common problem and can be treated with replacement thyroxine. Veronica will need ongoing follow up to ensure that correct dose is given. The most common cause of hypothyroidism in Australia is autoimmune chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, characterised by raised circulating levels of thyroid peroxidase antibody.
[PITFALL]
The doctor should avoid prematurely attributing the tiredness to Veronica’s ‘time of life’. Equally it is realistic to tell patients that the chance of finding treatable cause is low. This lays the foundation for taking a holistic approach to address psychological issues, work/life balance and expectations, sleep, diet and exercise.

You decide to see your usual GP for help.
In the latter part of her life your mother was partially sighted due to glaucoma. You have heard that this runs in the family and are worried that this is what’s causing the watering. You will only admit to this if the doctor is sensitive and empathic in their approach to you.

[COMMENTARY]
Dry eyes are a common problem in the elderly that can readily be diagnosed and treated in general practice. The GP will be able to get Edward back to regular golf and reassure him that these symptoms do not indicate that he is getting glaucoma. However, Edward will require regular optometry checks on his pressure and visual fields.
As people age, less oily tears are produced. This reduced lubrication is felt particularly when outside, in arid areas and in air-conditioned rooms. The surface of the eye senses the dryness and reflex tearing (watery tears) occurs. The treatment is aimed at optimising the production of oily tears by bathing the eyelids, clearing any duct blockages and replacing the oily tears with artificial tears.
It is counter-intuitive to offer artificial tears to someone with watery eyes but is a simple way of improving someone’s quality of life.
[PITFALL]
Edward reports that he sometimes cannot see when he is playing golf. It is easy to assume that this is a problem with his visual acuity when in fact it is just that the excess watery tears reduce his vision. Careful questioning and assessment of visual acuity is needed to clarify the problem.

An Austrian tourist Henrik Schneider, aged 25, telephones you at 6.30 am saying he needs an urgent consultation for his painful, red right eye and you agree to see him. He is leaving in an hour for the town where the base hospital is located.
Henrik does not take any medication, has no known allergies and no significant past medical history.

[SECTION: Instructions_for_patient]
You are a 25-year-old student backpacking around Australia. Yesterday your right eye became painful, the vision was a bit blurred and the eye looked red when you looked in the mirror at the hostel. You thought it might be due to your contact lenses, and so started to wear your glasses.
This morning you are due to travel five hours in a coach to the nearest town with a hospital. However, your eye is now more painful and the vision more blurred so you decide to see the resident GP as soon as possible. Bright lights make the eye more painful.
You have not had this eye problem before and have not injured the eye or got anything in it.
You do not take any medication, have no known allergies and have no significant past medical history.

[DIAGNOSIS]
Iritis of right eye.
[MANAGEMENT]
Explain condition
Discuss with ophthalmologist at base hospital and arrange referral and review
Commence topical steroids if available
Not to wear contact lenses today.
[COMMENTARY]
‘Beware the unilateral red eye.’ Most common eye problems in general practice affect both eyes so the history of a unilateral red eye is significant. Henrik also has the three sentinel warning signs of pain, photophobia and blurred vision. The doctor should ask about a history of a foreign body or eye injury. Contact lenses increase the risk of corneal ulcers, which can become infected.
A pinhole creates a very narrow light path that requires little focusing prior to hitting the retina and so demonstrates the potential corrected visual acuity. Henrik’s reduced vision in the right eye is not corrected by using a pinhole. This shows the loss of vision in the right eye is not due to a refractive error so the doctor must look carefully for an ocular problem.
Starting topical steroids in the eye is potentially dangerous and it is essential that the doctor excludes a herpetic cause of the problem before commencing treatment, specifically by looking for a dendritic ulcer on fluorescein staining. If possible discuss the case with a specialist ophthalmologist. However, the distance between the patient and the base hospital means that the GP needs to start steroids to prevent further exacerbation of the iritis.

You are a 25-year-old tax manager studying for your Chartered Accountancy exams. For the last few months you have experienced intermittent bouts of abdominal pain, bloating and flatus. The pain can be so severe that you need to lie down but often you can continue at work. The pain comes on at any time and is a squeezing, cramp-like pain, usually in the left or right side of your abdomen. The pain is sometimes relieved by defaecating.
You have not lost weight, been nauseated or vomited. Your bowel habit alternates between constipation and passing hard, rabbit-like pellets, to diarrhoea. You do not pass any blood or mucus rectally. You have tried some herbal remedies and cutting out dairy and gluten from your diet but without success.
You want the doctor to make sure that you have nothing seriously wrong with you and to tell you what the problem is.

[SECTION: info_for_facilator]
All physical examination findings are normal. Please give the following clinical examination findings on specific request:

—Cognitive behaviour therapy, stress reduction
Referral—not needed initially
Follow-up.
[COMMENTARY]
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common problem that accounts for 0.3 per 100 patient presentations in Australian general practice and has a worldwide prevalence of 10–15%. IBS is diagnosed on clinical features and a minimum of investigations. The candidate should enable Jenna to tell her story about the symptoms, and check that there are no alarm symptoms, such as weight loss, vomiting or rectal bleeding. The examination should focus only on a check of the hands, the face and the abdomen.
Referral to a gastroenterologist is unnecessary at this stage. GPs can make the diagnosis mainly on clinical grounds, explain the condition and recommend initial symptomatic treatment. A full blood count and ESR or CRP should be done to exclude anaemia or inflammation; antiendomysial and antigliadin antibodies for coeliac disease should be performed if the diarrhoea predominates.
IBS involves the ‘brain–gut axis’ but the exact cause and effect are unclear. A staged approach to management is recommended. A modified exclusion diet and stepwise reintroduction of foods or trials of eliminating classes of food may be useful. Fibre, antispasmodics and peppermint oil were all found to be more effective than the placebo in one study. Antidepressants and psychological therapies can be effective in the treatment of IBS.
A poor candidate may initiate a large number of investigations or suggest early referral to a gastroenterologist.

You have been the licensee of a hotel for the last two years. You rarely see the doctor. Today you have asked for an urgent appointment because of bad abdominal pain.
You have a long-term drinking problem. Both your parents were alcoholic and although you saw the impact of alcohol on them, you started drinking at a young age. You have had a series of jobs working in the hospitality industry. You left your last job in a hurry as you had an MVA while drunk. The police were never able to establish a cause but you left the town to escape suspicion.
For the past few months you have switched to drinking port rather than wine. You have about a cask a day.
For the last 24 hours you have experienced constant severe abdominal pain, which radiates through to your back. The pain has been so bad that you can’t walk or work. You have come today because your partner has persuaded you. You have been vomiting and are off your food. You are sweating and feel generally weak.
You have not vomited blood and have no symptoms or signs of liver failure. You are very sensitive about your alcohol problem and will only open up about this if the doctor approaches the issue in a non-judgmental manner.

The doctor is expected to make the provisional diagnosis of pancreatitis and arrange for urgent admission to hospital via ambulance. A useful acronym for possible causes of pancreatitis is GET SMASHED:
Gallstones
Ethanol
Trauma
Steroids
Mumps
Auto-immune
Scorpion venom
Hyperlipidaemia
ERCP
Drugs, e.g. azathioprine
A good doctor will establish rapport with Mr Castallani and explore his alcohol consumption in a non-judgmental manner. The CAGE questionnaire is a useful tool for diagnosing alcoholism. The questions focus on Cutting down, Annoyance by criticism, Guilty feeling, and Eye-openers. Arrangements for another appointment should be suggested to discuss Mr Castallani’s drinking. Even if the admission shows that the pancreatitis was due to another cause, such as gallstones, this level of drinking is harmful.

[COMMENTARY]
Abdominal pain is a common problem with a wide differential diagnosis. A thorough history and examination in this case should give the doctor the clues needed to consider Crohn’s disease in the differential diagnosis. More common causes of pain and bleeding, such as infection, need to be excluded, prior to referral for endoscopy.

You are 49 years old and work as a teacher. Recently you have been feeling quite tired but had put it down to the extra responsibility that you have taken on at work. It was not too much of a surprise that the Red Cross found that you were anaemic but it has worried you. You have not been anaemic before.
If the doctor asks, you remember that you have had some indigestion recently. Again you had put it down to the extra work, but you do now carry around a packet of indigestion medication, which you bought from the pharmacy.
You eat a good diet with several serves of red meat per week. You have no respiratory symptoms. You have had some nausea but no vomiting. Your bowels are unchanged and there is no rectal bleeding. You have not lost any weight. You have a progesterone releasing intra-uterine system (Mirena) in-situ and as a result are amenorrhoeic.

[COMMENTARY]
This is a case of iron deficiency anaemia. A serum ferritin of <12 µg/dL is diagnostic of iron deficiency anaemia.
The doctor should make this diagnosis from the history and focus on finding the cause of the anaemia in a sensitive and systematic manner.
The combination of iron deficiency anaemia and indigestion suggests an upper gastrointestinal ulcer. In those under 55 years old a ‘test and treat’ policy is considered safe practice because of the high effectiveness of ulcer treatment plus the low yield for GI malignancy on scoping.
Arrangements for follow-up are essential to ensure that persisting indigestion or anaemia are investigated with both gastroscopy and colonoscopy.

[COMMENTARY]
Nicki has a common problem of gall bladder disease with the more unusual presentation of obstructive jaundice due to a blockage in the common bile duct. Her work in a bakery makes it a public health requirement that she is cleared of an infectious intrahepatic cause that she could spread, such as Hepatitis A. The GP is aware of her financial need to work but in this instance the public health need takes priority over the patient’s individual need.
Another twist to the consultation is the story of Nicki’s fear of surgery as a result of her mother’s death of a pulmonary embolism. The ideal is for the GP to allow Nicki to express this fear and then use the fear as a motivator for Nicki to lose weight which is important for her recovery from surgery in the short term and prevention of chronic disease.

The key issue in this case is to arrange appropriate investigations to exclude colorectal cancer. The past history of haemorrhoids could distract the doctor from making a full assessment of the current symptoms. It is an important aspect of clinical practice to elicit the patient’s ideas and expectations but doctors must make clinical judgments about the appropriateness of presumed diagnoses and specific requests. A good doctor will sensitively explore Mr Williams’s ideas about possible causes of the pain and bleeding and explain that more serious causes than haemorrhoids need to be checked out.
Most alarm features have poor sensitivity and specificity for colorectal cancer; any patient over 40 with rectal bleeding needs referral for a colonoscopy. Presence of haemorrhoids associated with bright red bleeding not mixed with stool can provide false reassurance as a cancer was present in 2% of patients with these symptoms who were referred to a diagnostic clinic.
This case usually leads to lively discussion about the appropriate time to tell a patient that their symptoms might be due to cancer. Our groups have not reached consensus on this! Some argue that there is no need to worry Mr Williams until the diagnosis is known whereas others argue that it is the patient’s right to know what the doctor is thinking. We all agree that if Mr Williams asks a direct question such as, ‘Do you think this might be cancer?’ we would answer, ‘Yes, it might be’ and then give him time to respond to this possibility. Further explanation and information would be tailored to his response.
No immunisation history is given. Doctors should note this and, if time permits, advise Mr Williams of the need to be up to date with tetanus, diphtheria and polio and offer to do this in another appointment (or refer him to the practice nurse).
This case asks about the initial investigations required. Further investigations may be required depending on the results of the initial tests.

You are fit and well and working hard towards your qualification as a financial adviser. Last week you attended the GP for a routine Pap smear.
Yesterday you received a phone call from the practice nurse asking for you to come in for urgent review. The doctor you saw is not available so you book in with the next available GP. It was difficult to sleep last night as you were worried about what had been found on the Pap smear.
If the doctor asks, you will tell them that:
* you have no symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease—no pelvic pain, urinary frequency, burning on passing urine, vaginal discharge, unexpected vaginal bleeding
* you live with your boyfriend David and have not had any other partner in the past year
* you used condoms for the first three months of the relationship but not in the past nine months
* last week was your first STI check
* your boyfriend David is asymptomatic
* you would like to have children in the future.
You want to know how you caught the infection, and if it means that David has been unfaithful.

[SECTION: Suggested_approach]
Suggested approach to the case
Establish rapport
Clarify reason for presentation about results
Outline clearly that the result is Chlamydia positive
Inform that Pap smear is negative
Doctors should ensure that Jules has an opportunity to ask questions and express any concerns or fears
During the consultation the following topics should be covered:
* Chlamydia needs treatment with antibiotics (seven days doxycycline or stat dose azithromycin)
* Check no contraindication to antibiotics
* Advise re risk of interaction between antibiotics and contraceptive pill and need for alternative protection, such as condoms, until seven days of contraception pill taking, after the antibiotics. (Condoms will also be advised until partner is treated and full STI screen negative.) To get seven days of contraceptive pill continuously, two packets may need to be run together
* Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection
* Jules needs a full STI screen with blood tests for HIV, Hepatitis B and syphilis
* Partner will need testing and treating
* Advise re need to use condoms until both treated
* Advise that Chlamydia is a notifiable condition
* Review to ensure Chlamydia has cleared—advice variable
Retest in 3–4 weeks or 3–4 months
* Discussion of implications on relationship
Untreated Chlamydia can be asymptomatic but infectious for up to 18 months
Possible that neither partner has been unfaithful since the beginning of this relationship.
Immunisations
This is an opportunity to remind Jules to book for her third Gardasil injection.
[COMMENTARY]
Giving results of tests that another practitioner requested is an increasingly common aspect of clinical practice now that many more GPs consult part-time. This case requires the candidate to pick up Jules’s concerns and reassure her that the Pap is normal but that the Chlamydia is a potentially serious problem that does need treatment. This should be done with sensitive honesty and being mindful of the implications of this diagnosis for Jules’s relationship. Treatment of any recent partners is also essential.
[PITFALL]
Wrong or inaccurate information has the potential to destroy the trust in David and Jules’s relationship, so GPs should cover the issue that Chlamydia can lie dormant and that current infection does not necessarily equate to recent acquisition and unfaithfulness.

A good doctor will
—Establish rapport
—Demonstrate empathy
—Explain diagnosis clearly
—Provide information and seek questions of clarification
—Sensitively handle emotional response
—Arrange clear plan for follow-up both short and long term.
[COMMENTARY]
GPs often have to break bad news. The skill of giving information sensitively needs practice as it can determine the patient’s response to the news. I tell myself that I am not responsible for the news but I am responsible for how it is delivered. Maintaining a relationship with a patient may be more important than ensuring patients are fully informed in one consultation, particularly now that strategies and drugs can effectively control HIV and significantly reduce morbidity and mortality.
This case tests a doctor’s ability to give information in clear English, free from medical jargon, and to judge the patient’s response to this information. The response to the information is then used as a gauge as to how to run the rest of the consultation.
The suggested approach includes the list of vaccinations recommended for HIV-positive individuals. The need for immunisation against Hepatitis B should be known but a wise doctor and safe GP will check the immunisation schedule guidelines for other requirements.
[PITFALL]
There is a risk that the doctor will do all the talking. When charged with the need to give information many doctors do just that. They talk and talk without giving any time or opportunity for the patient to react to the information. Chunking the information can overcome this. Each piece of information is given in a small chunk and then the patient is given an opportunity to respond.
Another trap is using medical terms that are beyond the patient’s comprehension. This can be a challenge for doctors whose first language is not English.

[COMMENTARY]
Kim has obstructive lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), a common problem for older men. The doctor will need to take a history of these symptoms and must not be too embarrassed to ask about sexual function. The most likely cause is benign prostatic hypertrophy but the doctor needs to ask about haematuria, weight loss, fatigue and bone pain, which would suggest carcinoma.
The examination will focus on the abdomen, including a rectal examination, and exclude an enlarged bladder. Rectal examination can now be done on simulated models and it is worth practising on such models if you can.
Testing for prostatic specific antigen (PSA) is controversial (see Jock Palmer Case 39 on pages 193–6). PSA testing is recommended after fully informed consent has been obtained in a man who is expected to live over ten years and would want further investigation and treatment, if the PSA is abnormal.
Kim’s history of hypertension increases the risk of renal failure, so it is reasonable for doctors to request renal function tests in this case. Because of the nocturia and frequency, Kim needs a fasting BSL to exclude diabetes. The RACGP recommend BSL screening for diabetes every three years.
An alpha-blocker relieves symptoms straight away but also has a hypotensive effect. It is not a first line antihypertensive as there is no proof of positive impact on cardiovascular events. Kim’s blood pressure will need monitoring for hypotension and a reduction in the perindopril dose may be indicated. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, such as finasteride, can take up to six months to work. Some patients may decide to purchase Saw palmetto from a health food shop as it has been suggested to be equal in efficacy to finasteride but a Cochrane review showed no improvement compared with placebo.

Early treatment of prostate cancer has not yet been proven to increase life expectancy
Does not fulfil criteria for a screening test.
[COMMENTARY]
This case tests the doctor’s ability to advise patients on a controversial topic. The hope was that PSA testing would enable early detection of prostate cancer and, by allowing early treatment, improve prognosis. The evidence is that prostate cancer screening can reduce risk of death from prostate cancer but the absolute benefit is small, and the chance of prostate cancer being diagnosed and treated (even if biologically unimportant) is increased by a much larger amount. Jock’s confusion at the information that he was given is not surprising and the doctor needs to try to explain the principles of screening, the concepts of false-negatives and false-positives and enable Jock to make the right decision for himself.
The doctor needs to have a clear understanding of the criteria for a useful screening test. The WHO defined these as follows:
1. The condition should be an important health problem
2. The natural history of the condition should be understood
3. There should be a recognisable latent or early symptomatic stage
4. There should be a test that is easy to perform and interpret, acceptable, accurate, reliable, sensitive and specific
5. There should be an accepted treatment recognised for the disease
6. Treatment should be more effective if started early
7. There should be a policy on who should be treated
8. Diagnosis and treatment should be cost-effective
9. Case finding should be a continuous process.
The PSA test does not fulfil these criteria.

[COMMENTARY]
Infertility affects 15% of couples, and 5% of male infertility is potentially correctable. It is unrealistic in a single consultation to find the cause of the problem but Costa needs to leave this consult sensing that he is supported and that the doctor has set up a management plan.
It is important for the doctor to reassure Costa that chickenpox does not cause infertility. He is confusing chickenpox with mumps.
Hormone measurements can help determine whether the patient has gonadotropin deficiency (low testosterone and low or inappropriately normal LH and FSH), primary testicular failure (low testosterone, elevated LH and FSH), spermatogenic failure (normal testosterone and LH, elevated FSH), or androgen resistance (high testosterone, elevated LH). A majority of infertile men have normal testosterone, LH, and FSH levels. Obstruction should be ruled out in azoospermic men with normal testosterone, LH, and FSH levels. Yq microdeletions are the most prevalent cause of spermatogenic failure in men with azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia. Infertile men with azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia should undergo karyotyping and testing for Yq microdeletions.
[PITFALL]
A pitfall to avoid is agreeing with Costa that he is without doubt the cause of the problem. Brenda’s previous pregnancy is not proof of current fertility. Joint consultations with the GP emphasise that this is an issue for Brenda and Costa as a couple, not just for one partner. This can be suggested for the future. The opportunities in this consultation are to conduct the physical examination and discuss problems such as Costa’s drinking (alcohol can suppress spermatogenesis).

[COMMENTARY]
Agoraphobia is a disabling condition that GPs may have limited experience of the illness itself prevents sufferers from attending for help. The illness can be improved with treatment. Initially home visits may be the only way to provide assistance for the agoraphobia, preventive health care and the management of other acute or chronic problems.
In this case it is important for the doctor to establish rapport with Phyllis and demonstrate empathy for her problem.
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is more effective—and more cost-effective—than medication. Phyllis may be able to access CBT via a Mental Health Care plan. Free online access to CBT training is another option, for example, MoodGYM (http://moodgym.anu.edu.au). Developing new skills such as mindfulness meditation can help.
SSRIs and TCAs are equal in efficacy with SSRIs more often used because of their relative lower side effect profile and safety in overdose. Benzodiazepines are not recommended but may have a place in specific situations, such as enabling Mrs Brown to attend an important event such as a family wedding.
[PITFALL]
A doctor who is not able to establish rapport with Phyllis will fail to elicit the full list of symptoms from her. This most often occurs when doctors bombard patients with questions rather than listening carefully to their story. Another pitfall is telling Phyllis that she must come to the surgery for checkups soon. This fails to recognise her illness and risks making her feel worse. Similarly, advising that she should ‘pull herself together’ or that a ‘cure’ is guaranteed are unrealistic and unhelpful.
Note: in the time available for a short case the doctor is unlikely to be able to give details of the treatment options as detailed above. It would be sufficient to mention referral, medication and psychological assistance.

[COMMENTARY]
Postnatal depression is a common problem in general practice and can present with physical symptoms, particularly sleep disturbance as in this case. The doctor will need to be sensitive in giving this potential diagnosis. Shirley may see this diagnosis as confirmation of her self-perceived failure in life or have strong reasons from her work as a nurse to deny that this is the problem.
The doctor needs to assess the severity of the depression, consider Shirley’s safety and the safety of the children, and then negotiate with Shirley regarding the different management options. The doctor can be optimistic that the situation will improve but must be realistic that it will take time.
[PITFALL]
A poor or inexperienced doctor will miss that this is postnatal depression and organise further tests or a specialist referral to chase a physical cause for the tiredness. This is an inappropriate use of resources and denies Shirley access to the assistance she needs to improve her mental health and the short-term and long-term health of her children.

If the doctor asks sensitively you will reveal that three years ago you had an asthma attack when leading a tour group in a cave. You did not have any salbutamol with you.

[SECTION: Suggested_approach]
Suggested approach to the case
Establish rapport
Explore Monica’s ideas, concerns and expectations.
Assessment of the problem
Ask about recent event on flight
Sensitively probe for possible precipitating event
Explain correlation between significant event and current symptoms
Exclude underlying generalised anxiety or depression or substance misuse.
[MANAGEMENT]
Reassure that can be assisted
Short term—can use benzodiazepines for specific situations but risk of addiction, not suitable for long-term use
Longer term—cognitive behavioural therapy
Review or arrange for review of chronic disease
—Asthma control, inhaler technique
—Need for flu vaccine.
[COMMENTARY]
Monica describes anxiety attacks when in confined spaces (claustrophobia) that started when she was underground and had an asthma attack without having her inhaler nearby. Since that incident she has changed jobs and avoided closed spaces whenever possible. However, she now has the chance to travel and does not want to miss out.
In the short term benzodiazepines are effective anxiolytic drugs. But patients can become reliant on them and so alternative ways to manage the anxiety in the long term are preferred. Cognitive behavioural therapy is the treatment of choice and can be offered by trained GPs or via referral to a psychologist, either privately or after completion of a GP Mental Health Care plan.
Anxiety is common and disabling with an estimated 1.6 million presentations to Australian GPs per year. It is important for the doctor to establish that Monica’s anxiety is specific to a situation and is not part of a more pervasive mental health problem. Strategies used to cope with anxiety include ‘self-medicating’ with alcohol or illegal drugs such as marijuana, or avoidance of likely precipitating events or functions. It is worth checking that Monica’s couple of drinks prior to her most recent plane trip was a one-off, not a routine part of life, and assessing how much she has altered her life to avoid an anxiety attack.
[PITFALL]
Beta-blockers can be effective in reducing the physical symptoms of anxiety and are a useful first line therapy EXCEPT in asthmatics like Monica, for whom they can cause fatal bronchoconstriction.

[INSTRUCTION]
Tom’s mother has made this appointment to talk with you about psychosis; she has heard from a friend that Tom is at risk of schizophrenia.
[SCENARIO]
Last week you were on call and admitted Tom Newton to the local mental health unit. Tom is 20, lives with his parents and is in second year Engineering at university.
Tom’s parents called you as his behaviour was markedly disturbed; they suspect Tom has been using street drugs. For the previous week the television had been telling Tom that it was his role to save the world from itself. When Tom said that the TV had told him that he had to die to save the world, his parents sought help.
The hospital has told Tom’s parents that he has had an acute psychosis.

[SECTION: Instructions_for_patient]
You are nearly 60 years old and about to retire from your position as a school secretary. When you retire you are planning to travel round Australia.
Your eldest daughter is married and lives nearby. Tom, your son, is 20 and still at home. He is in his second year of an engineering degree. Some of Tom’s university friends seem weird to you and you suspect Tom has been trying illicit drugs.
Over the past few weeks Tom’s behaviour had become increasingly worrying—he was saying that the television wanted him to save the world. When Tom announced that the TV had told him that he had to die to save the world, you and your husband decided to take Tom to the local GP.
Tom was admitted to the mental health unit at the hospital. The psychiatrist has said that Tom has had an acute psychosis. A friend told you that acute psychosis can lead to schizophrenia. You have made this appointment with the GP to find out more about this illness. You are likely to ask the following questions:
* What is an acute psychosis?
* What is schizophrenia?
* Can it be cured?
* What causes it?
* Was it my fault?
* What will happen to Tom now?
* Will I still be able to go round Australia as planned?

[SECTION: Suggested_approach]
Suggested approach to the case
Establish rapport
Enquire about Tom’s mother’s ideas, concerns and expectations re acute psychosis and schizophrenia
Not clear diagnosis as yet—one psychotic episode is not diagnostic of schizophrenia, but acknowledge that Tom is at risk of schizophrenia
Explain that you can only talk in general terms, not specifically about Tom, because of confidentiality requirements
Target answers to Ann’s concerns
Dispel myths, e.g. not split personality
Diagnostic features
—Gradual change (prodrome usually about two years)
—Changes in thinking, mood and behaviour

—Believing things to be true that are not (delusions)
—Thought disorders
Negative symptoms
—Abnormal affect
—Talking less (poverty of speech and poverty of content of speech)
—Reduced motivation
—Social withdrawal
Causes
—Multifactorial, combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors
—Link with illicit drugs, cannabis and amphetamines
Advise of improved outcomes with early intervention
Advise of current therapies
[TREATMENT]
—Aim to reduce symptoms, prevent relapse, early intervention of relapse
—Antipsychotics
—Family support
—Community mental health team
Acknowledge any emotional response, e.g. shock and sadness
Assure Ann of your ongoing interest and support, and support groups for families caring for the mentally ill
Acknowledge planned trip around Australia, too early to make definite decision, continue to make plans to go.
[COMMENTARY]
Acute psychosis is frightening to see for all involved. Tom’s and his family’s world has suddenly changed; Ann needs support and space to express her concerns and adjust to the new situation. Ann also needs help trying to decide what to do about her plans for travelling around Australia after retirement.
Without Tom’s permission the GP cannot give specific information to Ann but instead has to give general advice. But there is still plenty to say, and the GP should use this as an opportunity to let Ann vent her concerns.
Medicine’s understanding of psychosis and schizophrenia is at an exciting stage. Early intervention can help people maintain cognitive and social function. Cautious optimism is appropriate, particularly if Tom is able to stay off illicit drugs.
[PITFALL]
In practice, especially when as a GP you care for whole families, it can be hard to remember who has given permission for you to say what to whom. Things can never be ‘unsaid’ so if anything, it is wise to be cautious rather than overly open. Conversely, saying nothing at all is unhelpful as evidence suggests that Tom will do best if he has his family’s support.

You are a 46-year-old Aboriginal man. You work as finance officer for the local council. You have come to see the GP today because of a pain in your right heel. The pain is worse first thing in the morning or after a period of sitting down, and occurs when you put your heel down. The pain eases after you have been up for a while, but it gets worse after walking any distance. It is worse when you walk around barefoot.

Reassurance not caused by ankle injury
[TREATMENT]
—Stretching exercises—of plantar fascia and Achilles tendon
—Arch supports and heel cushions
—Ice
—Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication
—Avoid walking barefoot or wearing flat shoes
If not settling consider referral/steroid injection or trial of custom-made night splints.
[COMMENTARY]
It is important to take the history of the recent fall but to realise that this is not the actual cause of the problem, and explain this to Anthony. Plantar fasciitis is a clinical diagnosis that does not require further investigation. The presence or absence of heel spurs is not helpful in diagnosing plantar fasciitis; X-rays are only needed if other diagnoses seem likely.
Most patients with plantar fasciitis improve with conservative or no therapy. Anthony can be advised to try shoe inserts and stretching of the plantar fascia. Ice may be worth a try, but his higher risk of renal disease suggests caution with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories. Custom-made orthotics and night splints may help, as may shock therapy and steroid injections though these may risk longer term tendon rupture. Steroid injections are very painful and so an ankle block can be used. Failed initial treatment is an indication for specialist surgical referral. Some cases persist despite surgery.
Anthony may benefit from encouragement on exercise he can do that will not exacerbate his heel pain, such as cycling or swimming. Losing weight will reduce the load on the ankle and can help. A good candidate will arrange follow-up to check Anthony’s blood pressure, BMI, other cardiac risk factors and immunisation status.

[COMMENTARY]
Shoulder pain is common in general practice. Most commonly the pain is musculoskeletal in origin but it can also signify serious visceral pathology. GPs must be able to conduct a thorough shoulder examination, report their findings clearly and synthesise the information from the history and examination to form a differential diagnosis.
Finding pathology on ultrasound is common and does not necessarily correlate well with the clinical picture. Research suggests that GPs are over-reliant on investigations. In many cases a focused but thorough history and examination provide sufficient information to form a differential diagnosis and a management plan.

[COMMENTARY]
The doctor needs to establish a rapport with Mrs Cosgrove and request permission to examine her. Some doctors I’ve watched have achieved this by briefly summarising the story to show Mrs Cosgrove that they understand what the issues are.
The doctor must conduct the examination efficiently, moving with ease from one aspect to the next and not cause unnecessary pain. The examination should appear as a well-rehearsed routine; it is obvious to observers when doctors are thinking what to do next rather than being able to focus on the findings and their interpretation.
The most likely diagnosis is osteoarthritis of the right hip. The doctor should suggest a range of pharmaceutical, surgical and non-pharmaceutical options for treatment.

You are a 25-year-old self-employed plumber. The business has been going badly and you have been getting increasingly tired at work. You have wanted to take time out of work but cannot afford to.
Last week you were driving to work when a truck went very slowly into the back of your car while you were stationary at traffic lights. You attended the hospital emergency department where you were examined. The doctor said that you did not need X-rays but you insisted that they to do some; no fractures were identified.
It is now a week after the accident and you have come to see your GP for review. The brake and indicator light of your work ute needed replacement but otherwise it was fine.
The truck driver’s insurance company has already arranged for the repairs to your car, so you could get back to work next week. You have had one week off but want to take more time out. Your neck was a bit sore after the accident and you get mild pain at the end of the day. You have no other residual symptoms.

[COMMENTARY]
This case tests the GP’s applied professional knowledge and skill and also their professional and ethical role. The car accident and resulting insurance claim have given Jeremy his first paid time off in years. He is still tired and he thinks that more paid leave from the truck driver’s insurance company would really help him.
A clinical assessment of the neck injury is required plus a decision about whether further sick leave is indicated. The minimal residual pain and absence of physical signs demonstrate that Jeremy is fit to return to work. The doctor must avoid collusion and signing Jeremy off for unjustified further sick leave. Timely return to activity is important to prevent chronic symptoms and to be fair to the insurance company.
The GP will need to make Jeremy feel supported and understood with regard to his injury and his business pressures but at the same time be clear that there is no justification for further sick leave. The GP can offer follow-up about the accident, the business pressures and preventive health.

[COMMENTARY]
Geoff’s symptoms should suggest the diagnosis to the doctor almost before the scenario begins. The doctor can then demonstrate their skills by excluding other serious pathology, and clinch the diagnosis by identifying the epicondylar pain and reproduction of the pain on active resistance to wrist extension.
A good doctor will give a clear explanation of the problem in simple terms and then outline the options for treatment, carefully excluding any pre-existing contraindications. Tennis elbow is considered to be an overload injury, typically presenting after minor and often unrecognised trauma of the extensor muscles of the forearm. As the evidence on the best treatment for tennis elbow is limited, it is important to involve Geoff in the decision regarding treatment. Steroid injection can give rapid pain relief in the short term but long-term evidence is less clear.
[PITFALL]
There is time to complete the history, examination and management but only if the doctor focuses on the elbow. A poor doctor might be unnecessarily extensive with history-taking and examination, leaving no time for discussion regarding management. No investigations are needed for this diagnosis, nor is early referral to an orthopaedic surgeon.

[COMMENTARY]
Mick has probably injured his cartilage in a fall playing soccer. The doctor should have a clear idea that this is the most likely problem from the history before entering the room. Further history should be taken to confirm this as the most likely problem. The doctor should then proceed to demonstrate a thorough knee examination in the order of look, feel and move.
All doctors should be able to systematically examine a joint. Practice is needed to ensure that the examination is neither too rough nor too gentle. It is acceptable to elicit some tenderness but not agony!

Establish rapport
Clarify site of pain
Request permission to conduct examination and undress the patient appropriately down to underwear.
Patient standing
Look at posture and gait
Look and feel for steps or gaps in vertebrae
Active movements
—Flexion/extension
—Lateral flexion both sides
—Rotation both sides
Patient supine
Straight leg raise
—Kernig’s sign: with the patient supine, the affected leg is fully bent in flexion at the hip and knee, and subsequent extension in the knee is painful
—Lasegue’s sign: with the patient supine, the straight leg raise test is positive if pain in the sciatic distribution is reproduced between 30° and 70° passive flexion of the straight leg
Tests of peripheral nerve function lower limbs
Power
—Walking on toes (mainly S1)
—Walking on heels (mainly L5)
Squatting—exacerbates back pain
Sensation
Reflexes
Patient prone
Palpate spine for tenderness including sacroiliac joints
Patient sitting
Slump test.
[DIAGNOSIS]
Lumbar radicular pain.
[COMMENTARY]
Back pain affects up to 80% of the Australian population at some time making examination of the back a commonly required skill in clinical practice. This case should be straightforward as doctors fluently and systematically examine Susan and synthesise the findings. The key issue is to identify the L5/S1 disc space as the site of tenderness and demonstrate full neurological function despite the sciatic nerve symptoms and positive slump test, Kernig’s sign or Lasegue’s sign.
Susan can be advised to use analgesia, cold or heat packs and plan an early return to work. She should be active but stop any activity that makes her symptoms worse, such as netball. The most common cause of lumbar radicular pain is lumbar disc herniation. No imaging is needed as Susan has no ‘red flag’ indications (i.e. unrelenting back pain, fever, trauma, history of cancer, loss of bowel or bladder control, age older than 50 years, or acute weight loss and pain not resolving within 4–6 weeks).
