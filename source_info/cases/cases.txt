[SECTION: Instructions_for_patient]

You are 14 years old and attend the local high school. Your zits dominate your life. Each morning your mum shouts at you to get dressed and ready for school while you stare at your zits in the mirror. You are convinced that you will never have a boyfriend like all your other friends. You used to take comfort in eating chocolate and cheese but have stopped since a friend said that was causing your zits.
You are embarrassed to be going to see the GP and hope the doctor will be kind.

[CASE_ID: Erin_Campbell]
[SECTION_ID: Adolescent_health]
[SECTION: Suggested_approach]
Establish rapport with Erin
Open-ended questions to explore Erin’s concerns and expectations about her acne.
[SPECIFIC_QUESTIONS]
Duration of acne
Location of acne
Impact of acne on social life and relationships
What has she tried so far as treatment?
What does she think causes the acne?
General health, e.g. are her periods regular?
Request permission to examine.
[EXAMINATION]
Examine the face
—confirm acne
—describe signs: comedones, pustules, erythema or scarring.
[MANAGEMENT]
Explain medical understanding of cause of acne without using jargon
Reassure that diet is not proven to change acne
Reassure that acne can be controlled, should not stop her socialising
Advise against picking or squeezing
Offer treatment depending on what Erin has already tried
Advise regular washing with soap
Avoid oily or greasy skin preparations
Treatment takes 4–8 weeks to be effective, can combine topical and oral treatments
Reduce excess cells (hyperkeratinisation)
Topical retinoids, azelaic acid
Reduce bacteria (propioniobacterium acnes)
Benzoyl peroxide, strength according to skin type
Topical antibiotics (combine with Benzoyl peroxide to reduce antibiotic resistance)
Oral antibiotics—tetracyclines not recommended until bone and teeth development complete
Rebalance hormones (reduce androgen excess)
Oral contraceptives containing an anti-androgen, such as cyproterone with ethinyloestradiol
Reduce sebum hypersecretion
Oral isotretinoin—high risk of teratogenicity
Arrange follow-up.
[COMMENTARY]
Adolescent acne is a common problem and can lead to physical and psychological scarring. Myths about its cause abound but the doctor can reassure Erin that the acne is not her fault and is not related to junk food. However, there are other good reasons to encourage a healthy diet.
Typically many treatments will have been tried at home prior to consulting a GP. It is important to find out what Erin has tried so you are offering something new rather than a treatment that has already been tried and failed.
For some teenagers, the hidden agenda of an acne presentation is a request for contraception. This requires sensitive exploration. A phrase that I find useful is: ‘Some people who come to see me know that the contraceptive pill helps with their skin; is this the case with you?’ The question about Erin’s periods is to assess the likelihood of polycystic ovarian syndrome.
[PITFALL]
Teenagers determine the severity and impact of their acne, not doctors. This case tests the doctor’s ability to practise in a patient-centred framework. Low marks will be given to doctors who dismiss Erin as having a few pimples which are insignificant and which she should learn to live with.

Your family have always had ‘big bones’. As a child you accepted the fact that your Mum and Dad were on the sidelines at sports day rather than entering in the parents’ races. You are used to being part of a big family and shopping at the outsize stores. Whenever friends visit they can’t finish the amount of food they are given.
About three months ago you had a really bad attack of gastroenteritis. You were amazed to find that you lost weight. Losing weight made you feel great.
You found that if you made yourself vomit just after the evening meal at home you could lose weight without having to diet. Although the vomiting is not pleasant it makes you feel good because your figure is better and you are getting attention from the boys at the youth club.
Last week during a school trip your class teacher caught you making yourself sick after the evening meal. Your teacher phoned to make this appointment with your consent. You are 1.67 m tall and weighed 95 kg three months ago, giving you a BMI of 34 kg/m ². You now weigh 89 kg (BMI 29 kg/m ²).
You are very scared about seeing the GP.

[MANAGEMENT]

Raise possibility of an eating disorder
Perform physical examination
Urinalysis
Assure of ongoing support and follow-up
Reassure that assistance is available.
[COMMENTARY]
The aim of this case is for the doctor to develop a trusting relationship with Amanda and establish that she has an eating disorder. Sensitive questioning and active listening is needed to get Amanda to admit that she is making herself vomit. She does not meet the criteria for either anorexia or bulimia; however, the self-induced vomiting means she does have an eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS). Eating disorders affect 2–3% of people in Australia and are presenting earlier and in more boys than previously.
The SCOFF questionnaire provides a framework for asking about food and its place in people’s lives. Appropriate management is a combination of the medical aspects, such as a physical examination and investigations, and the psychosocial aspects. HEADSS is another useful framework for conversation with adolescents.
A poor or inexperienced doctor will focus solely on the medical implications of EDNOS and not consider the person and their situation and the emotion surrounding the problem. Feedback to the teacher can only be given with Amanda’s permission.
The doctor is not expected to give details of the proposed management in the time available, but should reassure Amanda that there are options for assistance which usually involve her family and a psychologist.

You are a rural battler. You have survived several droughts and floods and had rheumatoid arthritis during middle life. You are determined not to let old age beat you. You have coped since you were widowed and while you do not enjoy getting old you are proud of managing despite having only your cat for company.
You gave up expecting your children to be of any help to you long ago. They visit for just long enough to ease their guilt and run back to the city. If the children had their way they would parcel you up and put you in a home. It has worried them that you have mentioned a couple of recent falls. The children have asked your doctor to make a home visit to check that you are still safe.

Outline to Mrs Humphries that her cataracts and her toenails may be causing the falls
Explain treatment is available for both
Seek Mrs Humphries’ consent for referral and treatment
Ophthalmologist for cataracts
Podiatrist for toenails
Drug therapy
—Monitor current therapy
—Consider risk–benefits of warfarin
Maintain activity and mobility.
Other options to consider will depend on the services available locally but could include: occupational therapy, physiotherapy, social services, volunteer services such as Meals on Wheels, trial of hip protectors, aged care assessment team, referral to a falls clinic. The issues to include regarding home safety are:
—Current likelihood of fall—is she safe staying at home?
—Ability to feed, dress and bathe safely
—Clear passageways of curios and memorabilia
—Remove loose rugs
—Get frame/walking aid
—Telephone near bed
—Regular visitors
Arrange follow-up
Ask Mrs Humphries if she wishes you to discuss the outcome of the visit with her family.
[COMMENTARY]
This is a common general practice scenario: an elderly, independent lady who is at risk of losing her independence. Assessing Mrs Humphries at home is key to determining her level of risk and seeing life from her perspective. This richer understanding of the person and their life, compared to the impression gleaned in a clinic room, provides a good foundation for discussing her ability to continue to live independently.
Doctors are expected to demonstrate a systematic approach to the problem of falls in the elderly, addressing the physical, psychological and social issues. The history should focus on the details of the falls and on identifying a potential cause together with a risk assessment of the likelihood of further falls and significant injury for Mrs Humphries. Mrs Humphries’ perspective on the falls must be explored. Is she frightened and seeking residential care? Or would she prefer to stay at home despite the risks? Mrs Humphries’ past history of rheumatoid arthritis is a risk factor for osteoporosis. Interventions can help elderly people to live safely and independently and delay admission to hospital or nursing home-care. Evidence on falls prevention is mixed.
In this case the examination reveals cataracts and long toenails. The facilitator will only mention this pathology if asked. These are treatable and the doctor can be optimistic that Mrs Humphries can maintain her independence once these issues are dealt with appropriately. Before the cataracts are treated, the doctor may need to offer short-term residential care. I have seen one doctor offer to cut the toenails that day.
Referral to allied health services through the enhanced primary care items can follow completion of a care plan. Mrs Humphries might benefit from a home medicines review; it is imperative that her warfarin is reviewed—does the risk of warfarin therapy now outweigh its potential benefits?
[PITFALL]
This case requires the doctor to focus their questions and examination on the common causes of falls in the elderly. Doctors who take an overly detailed history or examination will run out of time and not progress to discussing management with Mrs Humphries.
Mrs Humphries is the doctor’s patient but the family have asked for the visit. It is important to involve her family in her care; however, her consent is needed before discussing the outcome of the visit with them.
There is a risk of either bowing to the relatives’ pressure and arranging admission for Mrs Humphries or colluding with Mrs Humphries’ denial of the issue and not taking action where it is needed.

Explain results in terms that Flora understands—scan demonstrates osteoporosis
Link osteoporosis with recent fracture
Explain risk of further fractures and need to prevent
Fracture and osteoporosis prevention
—Preventing falls—regular exercises to maintain sense of balance and proprioception, appropriate footwear, safety at home, caution at night. (For higher risk patients, consider occupational therapy assessment, walking aids and hip protectors)
—Exercise—30 to 60 minutes of moderate weight-bearing exercise 3–4 days per week
—Review of medication that predispose to bone loss/falls, e.g. steroids, sleeping tablets, anti-hypertensives can cause postural drop
—Avoid excess alcohol or caffeine. Don’t start smoking
Bone strengthening
—Calcium in diet—recommended amount of 1–1.5mg calcium per day, may need supplement if avoiding dairy foods because of hyperlipidaemia, advise re timing to ensure absorption
—Vitamin D—assess sun exposure, consider measuring Vitamin D
—Bisphosphonates, e.g. alendronate, advise re potential jaw problems and need to remain standing after taking it, available with government subsidy if T score is less than –3.0 or previous minimal trauma fracture
—Strontium or raloxifene (a selective oestrogen-receptor modulator) are second-line drugs. HRT is no longer recommended for osteoporotic fracture prevention.
Plan follow-up
—Recommend 3–4 weeks to review medication, reinforce lifestyle advice
—Repeat bone density scan in 2 years.
[COMMENTARY]
This case requires the GP to interpret Flora’s bone density scan results and give her understandable, practical information about osteoporosis and preventing falls. The Z-score compares Flora’s bone mineral density to that of other women of her age whereas the T-score compares Flora’s bone mineral density to that of normal young women. The T-score relates more closely to fracture risk. A T-score less than –2.5 is consistent with the diagnosis of osteoporosis and each standard deviation reduction in bone density is associated with an approximate doubling of the risk of hip fracture.
Bisphosphonates are considered first-line therapy because of their proven value in reducing verterbral and non-vertebral fracture risk and longer term safety/risk data. No study has directly compared bisphosphonates and strontium. The recommended daily intake of calcium for women over 50 is 1300 mg/day. This requires at least three serves of dairy per day with one of these being calcium fortified.
[PITFALL]
There is a risk of seeing osteoporosis and fracture prevention purely in terms of medication. Drugs play an important role but are only one aspect of management. Simple advice about maintaining fitness and balance, safety at home, a healthy diet and adequate but not excessive sun exposure is also needed. The challenge is to say this in a way that Flora does not feel patronised. She sees herself as a working teacher, not an old lady!

[COMMENTARY]
The first consultation for a new patient at a practice provides a good opportunity for a thorough medical review. Mrs Worthington’s drug regimen puts her at risk of hyperkalaemia and she needs urgent assessment of her electrolytes.
Mrs Worthington’s lethargy could be due to the recent relocation but, given her age, it is important to exclude other pathology. Doctors are expected to deal with the immediate issue of potential hyperkalaemia and then make arrangements for further review. This prioritisation of ‘what do I need to do today, what do I need to do in the next week, what do I need to do in the next month’ is an important skill for doctors to learn and demonstrate. The cost of admission creates a tendency to do everything at once for hospitalised patients, but in general practice the best use of resources and the best way to help patients to change is to establish priorities and work through them systematically over time.
This case is based on a true story. The patient was admitted to hospital because of the hyperkalaemia—an entirely preventable admission. In Australia up to 30% of hospital admissions in patients over the age of 75 are medication related, of which three-quarters are probably preventable.
[PITFALL]
Doctors should avoid unfair criticism of the doctor who instigated Mrs Worthington’s drug regimen. The ideal would be to discretely contact the prescriber and find out why this regimen was chosen, enabling the person to learn from the experience.

[COMMENTARY]
This is a common general practice situation. The first aim of this case is to ensure that the doctor has the skill to take over management of a patient from a colleague.
Traditional medical training is for doctors to plan patient management after taking a history and conducting an examination themselves. The increase in team practice now requires doctors who can pick up a consultation at different stages of the process. Reading the patient’s notes was considered ‘cheating’ prior to seeing patients as a medical student: now it is a prerequisite of every consultation. Scanning notes with an attitude of critical trust is needed.
The second aim is to ensure the doctor can think holistically about hypertension and cardiovascular risk rather than taking a narrow pharmaco-therapeutic view. Helen needs tailored, practical assistance in smoking cessation and adopting a healthy lifestyle.
Helen meets the criteria for starting medication for her blood pressure. The most common first choice in Australia is an ACE inhibitor; guidelines suggest that calcium-channel blockers are also first-line medication. The Heart Foundation recommends thiazides in those 65 or older.
Lastly, arrangements for ongoing monitoring and follow-up are needed.
